Software created by Maximilian Hrabowski for the 3D-Scanner 
L2000 3D-Scan of the company Conmark

This software was written as a software project in 2006 at the
Karlsruhe Institut of Technology
Applied Geometry & Computer Graphics
Am Fasanengarten 5

To compile and link qbeam3d you will need the following additional packages:

Qt 3.x (www.trolltech.com)

## goal

Restore the envoirment to get the scanner working at the Edinburgh Hacklab
